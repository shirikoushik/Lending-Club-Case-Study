## Conclusions
1) Club should issue balanced number of loans to borrowers from CA, FL and NY

2) Club should reduce issuing higher number of loans of 60 months tenure

3) Club should reduce issuing loans for credit card, debt consolidation

4) Borrowers are more likely to default if they have public derogatory records ,which is also related to their bankruptcy. So club shouldn't issue loans to people with public derogatory records.

5) Borrowers with their house in mortgage shouldn’t be issued loans amounts greater than 12000 and club should also issue balanced number of loans to them

6) Borrowers with higher annual income are more likely to completely pay off.
